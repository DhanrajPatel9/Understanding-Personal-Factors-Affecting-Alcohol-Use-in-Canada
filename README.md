# Understanding-Personal-Factors-Affecting-Alcohol-Use-in-Canada
This study is important as by understanding which personal factors most strongly linearly coincide with heavy drinking we will be able to take the first steps to help those who suffer from alcoholic addiction

In Canada, the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) is a national survey taken in a joint
venture between Statistics Canada and the Canadian Institute for Health Information that consists
of a volunteer based response survey that is open to Canadians. The goal of the survey is to
better understand the health of Canadians, the survey asks health related questions in many
categories including nutrition, drug use, alcohol use and other health related topics. In this study,
by using linear regression in conjunction with the 2017-2018 CCHS [1] we will investigate the
central research question of which personal factors of the survey participants most strongly
linearly correlate to their alcohol consumption trends. The personal factors include the personal
attributes of the survey participants which include their sex, age, family history and more.
Through a linear regression model we will be able to answer the goal of this study of better
understanding the alcohol consumption trends of Canadians by analyzing which personal factors
most heavily influence heavy consumption of alcohol.
This study is important as by understanding which personal factors most strongly linearly
coincide with heavy drinking we will be able to take the first steps to help those who suffer from
alcoholic addiction. Many studies have shown drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can lead to
a decline in one's health such as a study released by the World Health Organization (WHO)
where they found a link between excessive drinking and an increased risk of cancer [2]. These
negative effects impact the lives of everyday Canadians as we can see from a Global News report
which reported that there is a "silent epidemic of alcoholism" in Canada and that seven
Canadians pass away everyday from alcohol related symptoms [3]. From this we can see that
alcoholism is an important issue in Canada.
